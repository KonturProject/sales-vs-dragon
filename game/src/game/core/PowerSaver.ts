 *
 * Three rates: "active" (a finite tween is running in any scene, or a game event
 * arrived recently — events carry delayed follow-ups such as head loss and victory
 * that start tweens later), "ambient" (only endless pulsing tweens run) and "idle"
 * (nothing moves). The frame limit is Phaser's own `fps.limit`, retuned at run
 * time; it only decides how often the *game step* runs, the browser's animation
 * frame callback stays a near-free no-op in between.
